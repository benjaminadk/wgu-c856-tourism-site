## Taniti Tourism Project

### Premise
The website is an high fidelity interactive prototype created for WGU class C856 User Experience Design

### Comments
Instead of using a tool like Invision to prototype, I figured I could work just as fast with React.  Of course, 
using React has the added benefit of producing a usable website. I could optimize the website by moving the images 
to a CDN in the cloud. For now I have just optimized them for the web.

### NPM Packages
- Create React App
- React Router
- React Bootstrap
